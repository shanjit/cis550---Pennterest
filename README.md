Our project, Pennterest, is a photo pinning website based on the popular site Pinnterest. Similar to its

predecessor, Pennterest allows its users to create and share customized boards containing photos pinned by

the user. A user can pick photos to pin from Pennterest’s vast collection, or add photos himself. Pennterest

allows searches for photos within Pennterest’s database or more broad image searches over the whole web

using the Bing API. Based on what photos a user has pinned or given ratings too, as well as his particular

interests, users are given recommendations on other photos they may enjoy. Finally, Pennterest features

caching into a key-value store for frequently searched objects.
